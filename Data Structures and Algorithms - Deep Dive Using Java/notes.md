# Section 1: Introduction

Data Structure

* Organizes and stores data
* Each has strengths and weaknesses

"The fact is, there aren't just two sides to any issue, there's almost always a reange of responses, and 'it depends' is almost always the right answer in any big question" ~ Linus Torvalds

Algorithm - Instructions on how to achieve a particular task

* There can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task
* There can be many implementations of the same algorithm

No surprises in this section.
